# Lightweight-Deep-Learning-Framework (ing...)
A lightweight Deep learning framework using Python 

# Overview 

A lightweight deep learning framework using Python language, which enables create computation graph for gradient computation by automatic differentiation algorithm. It implements the sequence model, computation graph model, and numerous neural network building blocks such as layers, activation functions, optimizers.

# Requirement

- Python 3.6
- NumPy 1.16.5
